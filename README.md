What is Lambocoin?
----------------

Lambocoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Lambocoin uses a proof-of-stake method in order for
the Lambocoin blockchain network to achieve distributed consensus. Lambocoin Core is
the name of open source software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of the
Lambocoin Core software, see https://www.Lambocoin.com/#wallet.

Lambocoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Lambocoin
development team members simply pulls it.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see [doc/coding.md](doc/coding.md)) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/LambocoinFoundation/Lambocoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Lambocoin.
